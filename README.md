## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Recieve proper message when trying to type into the email input field.
- if the prefered-motion-reduce is on in the browser the scrolling animation is not applied.

## My process

- Follwing mobile-first approach, i wrote the styles struct using css custome properties, (colors, Typography, spaces, etc...).
- When working with a bit complicated project, i like to devide my style sheet to a multiple sheets so it would be easier when the
  codes grow.

#### for example:

- styles.css contains the base styles.
- shared folder:

  - header.css
  - hero.css
  - features.css
  - testimonials.css
  - cta.css
  - learnMore.css
    after finishing the styling, i will combine all the sub-files into one (styles.css) main file.

- this also applies to javascrip.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Javascript

### What I learned

- Improved my CSS skills especially working with consesntance styling using css custome properties.
- Using javascript to cntrol the navigation bar toggeling.
- Creating infinite horizontal scrolling bar.

### Continued development
